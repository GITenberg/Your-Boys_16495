<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am writing this during an air raid at 12.30 at night, and I have just
finished a Foreword for the Bishop of Zanzibar's new and tender little
book. He has been a water-carrier for the British force in German East
Africa, and Gipsy Smith has just come from the trenches in France.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You would not expect the two books to be similar, but they are: they are
both about <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus.”</span> This devotion to <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus”</span> binds all time Christians
together, and one day will bring us all more visibly together than we
are now. I love this breezy little book of Gipsy Smith's; it is not only
full of the love of <span class="tei tei-q">“Jesus,”</span> but love of our 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">“our boys.”</span> They <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></span>
splendid. I spent the first two months of the war as their visiting
chaplain—went out to give them their Easter Communion the first year of
the war at the Front. Gipsy Smith and I made friends together, speaking
for them at the London Opera House on the great day of Intercession and
Thanksgiving we had for them when the King himself called us all
together.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then I like the common sense of it! You must have robust common sense if
you are going to win <span class="tei tei-q">“our boys.”</span> Anything unreal, merely sentimental,
washy, they detect in a moment. You must draw them <span class="tei tei-q">“with the cords of a
man and the bonds of love,”</span> and those who read this book will find many
a hint as to how to do it.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have just come back from your boys. I have been living among them and
talking to them for six months. I have been under shell fire for a
month, night and day. I have preached the Gospel within forty yards of
the Germans. I have tried to sleep at night in a cellar, and it was so
cold that my moustache froze to my blanket and my boots froze to the
floor. The meal which comforted me most was a little sour French bread
and some Swiss milk and hot water, and a pinch of sugar when I could get
it.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are Y.M.C.A. marquees close to the roads down which come the
walking wounded from the trenches. In three of these marquees last
summer in three days over ten thousand cases were provided with hot
drinks and refreshment—free. And that I call Christian work. You and I
have been too much concerned about the preaching and too little about
the doing of things.
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page10">[pg 10]</span><a name="Pg10" id="Pg10" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A friend of mine was in one of those marquees at the time, and he told
me a beautiful story. Some of the men sat and stood there two and three
hours waiting their turn, and the workers were nearly run off their
feet. They were at it for three nights and three days. There was one
fellow, a handsome chap, sitting huddled up and looking so haggard and
cold, that my friend said to him,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am sorry you have had to wait so long, old chap. We're doing our
best. We'll get to you as soon as we can.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Never mind me,”</span> said the man; <span class="tei tei-q">“carry on!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As the sun came out he unbuttoned his coat, and when the coat was thrown
back my friend saw that he was wearing a colonel's uniform.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I am sorry, sir,”</span> said my friend. <span class="tei tei-q">“I did not know. I oughtn't to have
spoken to you in that familiar way.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You have earned the right to say anything you like to me,”</span> said the
Colonel. <span class="tei tei-q">“Go right on.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And then my friend said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, come with me, sir, to the back, and I
will get you a cup of coffee.”</span>
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page11">[pg 11]</span><a name="Pg11" id="Pg11" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No, not a minute before the boys. I'll take my turn with them.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That's the spirit. Your boys, I say, are great stuff. They have their
follies. They can go to the devil if they want to, but tens of thousands
of them don't want to, and hundreds of thousands are living straight in
spite of their surroundings. They are the bravest, dearest boys that God
ever gave to the world, and you and I ought to be proud of them. If the
people at home were a tenth as grateful as they ought to be they would
crowd into our churches, if it were for nothing else but to pray for and
give thanks for the boys.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They are just great, your boys. They saved your homes. I was recently in
a city in France which had before the war a population of 55,000 people.
When I was there, there were not 500 people in that city—54,500 were
homeless refugees, if they weren't killed. I walked about that city for
a month, searching for a house that wasn't damaged, a window that wasn't
broken, and I never found one. The whole of that city will have to be
rebuilt. A glorious cathedral, a magnificent pile of municipal
buildings, all in ruins; the Grande 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page12">[pg 12]</span><a name="Pg12" id="Pg12" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>Place, a meeting-place for the
crowned heads of Europe, gone! <span class="tei tei-q">“Thou hast made of a city a heap”</span>—a heap
of rubbish. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Your</span></span> city would have been like that but for the boys in
khaki.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was saying my prayers in a corner of an old broken chateau, the
Y.M.C.A. headquarters for that centre, with my trench-coat buttoned
tight and my big muffler round my ears. Presently I heard some one
say—one of the workers—<span class="tei tei-q">“A gentleman wants to see you, sir,”</span> and when I
got downstairs there was a General, a V.C., a D.S.O., and a Star of
India man—a glorious man, a beautiful character. He was there with his
Staff-captain, and he said,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I've come to invite you to dinner to-morrow night, Mr. Smith. I want
you to come to the officers' mess.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What time, sir?”</span> I asked. <span class="tei tei-q">“I cannot miss my meeting at half-past six
with the boys.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, the mess will be at half-past seven. We will arrange that.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Before you go, sir, I should like to ask why you are interested in me.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I'll tell you, if you wish,”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“Men are writing home to
their wives, mothers, sweethearts, and they are talking about a 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page13">[pg 13]</span><a name="Pg13" id="Pg13" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
new power in their lives. 'We have got something that is helping us to go
straight and play the game,' they write. And so,”</span> said the General, <span class="tei tei-q">“we
should like to have a chat with you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I went the next night, and for an hour and a half I preached the Gospel
to those officers. It was a great chance; and it was the result of the
note-paper which I have sometimes given out for an hour and a half at a
time to your boys.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There are lots of people think you are not doing any spiritual work
unless you are singing, <span class="tei tei-q">“Come to Jesus.”</span> Put more Jesus in every bit of
the day's business. Jesus ought to be as real in the city as in the
temple. If I read my New Testament aright, and if I know God, and if I
know humanity, and if I know Nature, then that is God's programme. God's
programme is that the whole of life should be permeated with Christ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
God bless the women who have gone out to help your boys. Women of title,
of wealth and position, serving God and humanity behind tea-tables.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In one of our huts I saw a lady standing beside two urns—coffee and
tea. She was 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page14">[pg 14]</span><a name="Pg14" id="Pg14" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>pouring out, and there were 150 or 200 men standing round
that hut waiting to get served. The fellows at the end were not pushing
and crowding to get first, but waiting their turn. They are more
good-natured than a religious crowd waiting to get in to hear a popular
preacher. I have seen these people jostle at the doors.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But your boys don't do that. They just sing, <span class="tei tei-q">“Pack up your troubles,”</span>
and wait their turn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Well, these boys, wet and cold, were waiting for a cup of coffee, and
one of those red-hot gospellers came along, and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sister, stop a
minute and put a word in for Jesus. This is a great opportunity.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“But,”</span> she replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“they are wet and tired; let me give them something
hot as soon as I can.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Oh! but let's put a word in for Jesus,”</span> urged this chap.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then a bright-faced soldier lad called out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Guv'nor, she puts Jesus in
the coffee.”</span> That is what I mean when I say you have got to put Jesus
into every bit of the day's work.
</p><div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page15">[pg 15]</span><a name="Pg15" id="Pg15" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have never once been asked by your boys to what Church I belonged.
They don't stop to ask that if they believe in you. They want the living
Christ and the living Message. It isn't creed; it's need. And don't you
get the notion that the boys can't be reached, and don't you think that
the boys are hostile to Christianity. They are not. I won't hear it
without protest. The best things that the old Book talks about are the
things the boys love in one another. They don't always think of the
Book, but they love the fruits of the Spirit in one another. They love
truth, honour, courage, humility, friendship, loyalty. And where do you

that Tree.

I had a dear friend who won the M.C.—a young Cambridge graduate. He was
all-round brilliant. He could write an essay, preach a sermon, sit down
to the piano and compose an operetta. The boys delighted in him. He
would always be at the front. He would always be where there was danger.
I was talking about him one day in one of the convalescent 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page16">[pg 16]</span><a name="Pg16" id="Pg16" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
camps, and
two of the boys said to me afterwards,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You have been talking about our padre. We loved him. We were with him
when he was killed, for the shell that killed him wounded us. Every man
in the battalion would have laid down his life for him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This old world's dying for the want of love. There are more people die
for the want of a bit of it than with overmuch of it. Don't stifle
it—let it out.

<span class="tei tei-q">“I am afraid,”</span> said a padre to me once, <span class="tei tei-q">“the boys are sceptical.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come with me to-morrow,”</span> I answered. <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll prove to you they are <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></span>
sceptical.”</span>
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We were half an hour ahead of time and the hut was crowded with eight
hundred men. They were singing when I got in—something about <span class="tei tei-q">“an old
rooster—as you used to.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Do you suppose I had no better sense than to go in and say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Stop this
ungodly music?”</span> You can catch more flies with treacle than with vinegar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I looked at the boys and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“That's great, sing it again.”</span>
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page17">[pg 17]</span><a name="Pg17" id="Pg17" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And I turned to the padre and asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“Isn't that splendid? Isn't that
fine?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
While we were waiting to begin the meeting, I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Boys, we must have
another.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One of the same sort?”</span> they shouted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Of course,”</span> was my reply. And they sang <span class="tei tei-q">“Who's your lady friend?”</span> and
when they had sung that, I called out, <span class="tei tei-q">“Boys, we will have one more.
What shall it be?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“One of yours, sir.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had not trusted them in vain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Very well, you choose your hymn.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“When I survey the wondrous Cross”</span>—that was the song they chose.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And they sang it all the better because I had sung their songs with
them. Before we had got to the end of the last verse some of those boys
were in tears, and it wasn't hard to pray. It isn't far from rag-time to
<span class="tei tei-q">“When I survey the wondrous Cross.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When they had finished the hymn I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Boys, I am going to tell you
the story of my father's conversion.”</span> For I had to convince my padre
friend that they were not sceptical. I took them to the gipsy tent and
told them of my father and five motherless children, and 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page18">[pg 18]</span><a name="Pg18" id="Pg18" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>of how Jesus
came to that tent, saving the father and the five children and making
preachers of them all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Did my father make a mistake when he brought Christ to those
five motherless children?”</span> And the eight hundred boys shouted, <span class="tei tei-q">“No,
sir.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Did he do the right thing?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What ought you to do?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“The same, sir.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you want Jesus in your lives?”</span> and every man of the eight hundred
jumped to his feet.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You say they are sceptical where Jesus is concerned. I'll tell you when
they are sceptical—when they see the caricature of Jesus in you and me.

I was, as I have said, under shell fire for a month in one place—night
and day for a month—and never allowed out without a gasbag round my
neck. I slept in a cellar there at night when I did sleep—only 700
yards from the Germans—and, as I have said before, it <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></span> cold.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When the thaw set in, I put a couple of bricks down and put a box-lid on
top, so that I could stand in a dry place. We had two picks and two
shovels in that cellar in case anything happened overnight. I have been
up against it. Whenever I talked to the boys there they sat with their
gas-bags round their necks, and one held mine while I talked. It was
quite a common thing to have something fall quite close to us while we
were singing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Imagine singing <span class="tei tei-q">“Cover my defenceless head,”</span> just as a piece of the roof
is falling in. Or—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
then another crash! That makes things real. Every word was accompanied
by the roar of guns—the rattle of the machine gun and the crack of the
rifle. We never knew what it was to be quiet.

A shell once came and burst just the other side of the wall against
which I was standing and blew part of it over my head. I have suffered

If I had my way I'd take all the best preachers in Britain and I'd put
them down in France. And if the church and chapel goers grumbled, I'd
say, <span class="tei tei-q">“You're overfed. You can do without a preacher for a little.”</span> And
if they were to ask, <span class="tei tei-q">“How do you know?”</span> I should reply, <span class="tei tei-q">“Because it's

I once went to a hut just behind the line, within the sound of the guns.
Buildings all round us had been blown to pieces. The leader of this hut
was a clergyman of the Church of

England, but he wasn't an ecclesiastic

<span class="tei tei-q">“Gipsy Smith,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know what you will do; the boys in the

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you think they will come to the meetings?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know,”</span> he replied; <span class="tei tei-q">“they come for everything else! They come
for their smokes, candles, soap, buttons—bachelor's buttons—postcards,
and everything else they want. But whether they will come for the
religious part, I don't know.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“we can but try.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was about midday when we were talking, and the meeting was to be at
6.30.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Have you got a boy who could write a bill for me?”</span> I asked.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Print it on green paper,”</span> said I.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

mighty hard in business, why shouldn't we think in the religious
world?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Just say this and nothing more,”</span> I said.

<span class="tei tei-q">“'<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gipsy Smith will give a talk in the Hut to-night at</span></span> 6.30.

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I knew that would fetch them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
At half-past six the hut was crowded with eight hundred Munsters. If you
are an old angler, indeed if you know anything at all about angling, you
know that you have got to consider two or three things if you are to
stand any chance of a catch. You have got to study your tackle, you have
got to study your bait, you have got to study the habits of your fish.
When the time came to begin that meeting, one of the workers said,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Shall I bring the box of hymn-books out?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No, no,”</span> I replied; <span class="tei tei-q">“that's the wrong bait.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those Munster boys knew nothing about hymn-books. We preachers have got
to come off our pedestals and not give our hearers what we want, but the
thing that will catch them. If a pretty, catchy Sankey hymn will attract
a crowd, why shouldn't we use it instead of 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page23">[pg 23]</span><a name="Pg23" id="Pg23" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>an anthem? If a brass band
will catch them, why shouldn't we play it instead of an organ?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Keep back those hymn-books,”</span> I said. <span class="tei tei-q">“They know nothing about
hymn-books.”</span> I had a pretty good idea of what would have happened if
those hymn-books had been produced at the start.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I got on that platform, and I looked at those eight hundred Munsters and
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Boys, are we down-hearted?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">No</span></span>,”</span> they shouted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You can imagine what eight hundred Munsters shouting <span class="tei tei-q">“No”</span> sounds like.
They were all attention instantly. I wonder what would happen if the
Vicar went into church next Sunday morning and asked the question, <span class="tei tei-q">“Are
we down-hearted?”</span> I knew it would cause a sensation, but I'd rather have
a sensation than a stagnation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those boys sat up. I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are going to talk about gipsy life.”</span> I
talked to them about the origin of my people. There's not a man living
in the world who knows the origin of my people. I can trace my people
back to India, but they didn't come from India. We are one of the oldest
races in the world, so old that 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page24">[pg 24]</span><a name="Pg24" id="Pg24" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>nobody knows how old. I talked to them
about the origin of the gipsies, and I don't know it, but I knew more
about it than they did. I talked to them about our language, and I gave
them specimens of it, and there I was on sure ground. It is a beautiful
language, full of poetry and music. Then I talked about the way the
gipsies get their living—and other people's; and for thirty minutes
those Munsters hardly knew if they were on the chairs or on the
floor—and I purposely made them laugh. They had just come out of the
hell of the trenches. They had that haunted, weary, hungry look, and if
only I could make them laugh and forget the hell out of which they had
just climbed it was religion, and I wasn't wasting time.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When I had been talking for thirty minutes, I stopped, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Boys,
there's a lot more to this story. Would you like some more?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> they shouted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Come back to-morrow,”</span> I said.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was fishing in unlikely waters, and if you leave off when fish are
hungry they will come back for more. For six nights I told those boys
gipsy stories. I took them out into the 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page25">[pg 25]</span><a name="Pg25" id="Pg25" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>woods. We went out amongst the
rabbits. I told the boys the rabbits got very fond of me—so fond that
they used to go home with me! I took them through the clover-fields on a
June day and made them smell the perfume. I took them among the
buttercups. I told them it was the Finger of Love and the Smile of
Infinite Wisdom that put the spots upon the pansy and the deep blue in
the violet. And then we went out among the birds and we saw God taking
songs from the lips of a seraph and wrapping them round with feathers.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the boys saw Jesus in every buttercup and every primrose, and every
little daisy, and in every dewdrop, and heard something of the song of
the angels in the notes of the nightingale and the skylark. Oh! Jesus
was there, and they felt Him, and they saw Him. I took them amongst the
gipsy tents, amongst the woodlands and dells of the old camping-grounds.
They walked with Him and they talked with Him. I didn't use the usual
Church language, but I used the language of God in Nature and the boys
heard Him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Towards the end of the week one of those Munster boys came and touched
me and said, 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page26">[pg 26]</span><a name="Pg26" id="Pg26" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span class="tei tei-q">“Your Riverence! Your Riverence!”</span> he says. <span class="tei tei-q">“You're a
gentleman.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">knew</span></span> I had got that boy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, if you are an old angler you know what happens if you begin to tug
at the line the first time you get a bite. When you hook a fish, if he
happens to be a Munster, you have got to keep your head and play him,
let him have the line, let him go, keep steady, no excitement, give him
play. I gave him a bit of line, that young Munster. I thanked him for
his compliment and then walked away—with my eyes over my shoulder, for
if he hadn't come after me I should have been after him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Presently he pulled my tunic and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Won't you give me a minute,
sir?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“What's the trouble?”</span> I said.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,”</span> he said, with a little catch in his voice that I can hear now,
<span class="tei tei-q">“you've got something I haven't.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“How do you know?”</span> I asked.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“It's like the singing of a little song, and it gets into my heart. I
want it. Won't you tell me how to get it? I want it.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Sonny,”</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“it's for you. You can have it at the same price I paid
for it.”</span>
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page27">[pg 27]</span><a name="Pg27" id="Pg27" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Begorra,”</span> says he, <span class="tei tei-q">“you will tell me to give up my religion, you will!”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“If God has put anything in your life that helps you to be a
better and a nobler and a braver man, He doesn't want you to give it
up.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“He doesn't?”</span> he asked. <span class="tei tei-q">“What am I to give up, then?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And I replied, <span class="tei tei-q">“Your sin.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The boy said again, <span class="tei tei-q">“You're a gentleman.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
If I had said one word about his religion or his creed, my line would
have snapped and I would have lost my fish.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That night, when all the boys had gone, we got into a corner and we
knelt down, and when he went he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I've got it, sir. I've got the
little song—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and it's singing</span></span>.”</span>

At one of my meetings the boys were four thousand strong and the
Commandant of the camp was to preside. As they say in the Army, he had
got the wind up. He did not know me. When he saw the crowd there he
began to wonder what was going to happen. He called one of the officers
to him, and said,
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I don't know what he's going to do. I hope 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page28">[pg 28]</span><a name="Pg28" id="Pg28" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>he's not going to give us a
revival meeting or something of that sort. I hope he knows that
one-third of these fellows are Roman Catholics.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Well, of course I knew, and I was laying my plans accordingly. What
right have you or I when we have got a mixed crowd like that to try to
cram our preconceived programme down everybody's throat? The officer,
who was one of my friends, said to the Colonel, <span class="tei tei-q">“I don't think you need
trouble, sir. He's all right, and knows his job.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When we were ready, I went to the Colonel, and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“We are quite ready
to begin, sir.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Colonel rose and announced, <span class="tei tei-q">“Officers, non-commissioned officers,
and men, I now introduce to you Gipsy Smith, who will perform.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, the first thing I wanted to do was to disarm all prejudice in the
mind of both officers and men. So I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Are you ready, boys?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

They were British boys and they knew what to do when the right moment
came. And so I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Boys, you sang that very well, but you were not

I was talking behind the lines to some of your boys. Every boy in front
of me was going up to the trenches that night. There were five or six
hundred of them. They had got their equipment—they were going on parade
as soon as they left me. It wasn't easy to talk. All I said was
accompanied by the roar of the guns and the crack of rifles and the
rattle of the machine guns, and once in a while our faces were lit up by
the flashes. It was a weird sight. I looked at those boys. I couldn't
preach to them in the ordinary way. I knew and they 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page31">[pg 31]</span><a name="Pg31" id="Pg31" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>knew that for many
it was the last service they would attend on earth. I said,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Boys, you are going up to the trenches. Anything may happen there. I
wish I could go with you. God knows I do. I would if they would let me,
and if any of you fall I would like to hold your hand and say something
to you for mother, for wife, and for lover, and for little child. I'd
like to be a link between you and home just for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></span> moment—God's
messenger for you. They won't let me go, but there is Somebody Who will
go with you. You know Who that is.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
You should have heard the boys all over that hut whisper, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,
sir—Jesus.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I want every man that is anxious to take Jesus with him
into the trench to stand.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Instantly and quietly every man in that hut stood up. And we prayed as
men can pray only under those conditions. We sang together, <span class="tei tei-q">“For ever
with the Lord.”</span> I shall never sing that hymn again without a lump in my
throat. My mind will always go back to those dear boys.

cottage where I was billeted I heard feet coming behind me, and
presently felt a hand laid upon my shoulder. Two grand handsome fellows
stood beside me. One of them said,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“We didn't manage to get into the hut, but we stood at the window to
your right. We heard all you said. We want you to pray for us. We are
going into the trenches, too. We can't go until it is settled.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We prayed together, and then I shook hands with them and bade them
good-bye. They did not come back. Some of their comrades came—those
two, with others, were left behind. But they had settled it—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">they had

Two or three days after that I was in a hospital when one was brought in

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

One night I had got about fifty boys round me in a dug-out, with the
walls blown out and

for I love to hear them sing. I never choose a hymn for them—I always
let them choose their own hymns. There is wisdom in that. If they have
asked for something and don't sing it, I can come down on them. Among
the great hymns they choose are these:</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: center">“Jesu, Lover of my soul,”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">and I have heard them sing,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: center">“Cover my defenceless head,”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">with the shells falling close to them. I have heard them sing,</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-q" style="text-align: center">“I fear no foe ...”</span></p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">with every seat and every bit of building round us rocking with the
concussion of things. And then they will choose:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Instantly one of the boys brought out of his tunic about two inches of
candle and struck a match, and in three minutes we had about twenty
pieces of candle burning. It was a weird scene.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
After the hymns I began to talk, and the candles burnt lower, and some
of them flickered out, and I could see a boy here and there twitch a bit
of candle as it was going out.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Put the candles out, boys. I can talk in the dark.”</span>

There is no hymn of hate in your boys' hearts. I have known them take a
German prisoner even after he has played the cruel thing; but there! he

I was speaking at a convalescent camp. Every one of the boys had been
badly mauled and mangled on the Somme. This particular day I had about
seven or eight hundred listeners. It was evening, and when I had talked
to the boys, I said,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I wonder if any of you would like to meet me for a little prayer?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And from all over the camp came the answer, <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, sir; yes, sir; yes,
sir.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There was a big room there—we called it a quiet room—and so I asked
all the boys who would like to see me, just to leave their seats and go
into this room. I went to them and said,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“You have elected to come here to pray, so 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page36">[pg 36]</span><a name="Pg36" id="Pg36" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>we will just kneel down at
once. I am not going to do anything more than guide you. I want you to
tell God what you feel you need in your own language.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The prayers of those boys would have made a book. There were no
old-fashioned phrases. You know what I mean—people begin at a certain
place and there is no stopping them till they get to another certain
place. One of these boys began, <span class="tei tei-q">“Please God, You know I've been a
rotter.”</span> That's the way to pray. That boy was talking to God and the
Lord was very glad to listen.

Then he continued slowly, <span class="tei tei-q">“On the Somme, a few hours before I was badly

crucifix—<span class="tei tei-q">“I picked up that little crucifix and I put it in my pack, and
when I got to hospital I found that little crucifix on my table. One of
the nurses or the orderlies had put it there, thinking I was a Catholic.
But I know I'm not, sir. I am <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing</span></span>. I have been looking at this
little crucifix so often since I was wounded, and I look at it till my

this little bit of metal, but what it means.”</span>

prayer?”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“That's prayer of the best sort,”</span> I said. <span class="tei tei-q">“Every tear contained volumes
you could not utter, and God read every word. He knows all about it.”</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I pulled out a little khaki Testament. <span class="tei tei-q">“Would you like it?”</span> I said.

When I shook hands with him there was a light in his eyes. Have you ever

One hundred and fifty-two thousand cups of tea and coffee are given away

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the Madame of the restaurant came to me a little while afterwards,
and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“We dare not tell her, but they were all killed.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many people at home don't realise what is going on. Some are in
mourning, some have lost boys, some have lost husbands, brothers, but we
have not suffered as others have suffered. I was riding in a French
train a few weeks ago. Beside me sat a lady draped in mourning. I could
not see her face, it was so thickly veiled with crape. Beside her was a
nurse, and the lady wept, oh, so bitterly! I cannot bear to see anybody
weeping. If I see a little child crying in the street I want to comfort
it. If I see a woman crying in the street I want to comfort her. God has
given me a quick ear where grief is concerned—and I am thankful. I
wouldn't have it otherwise—though I have to pay for it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That woman's tears went through me. Every little while she was counting
in French, <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq,</span></span>”</span>—then she would weep again
and then she would count.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I said to the nurse, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nurse, what's the 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page43">[pg 43]</span><a name="Pg43" id="Pg43" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>trouble?”</span> and she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sir,
her mind has given way. Before the war she had five handsome sons, and
one by one they have been killed, and now she spends her time counting
over her boys and weeping.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And all that is for you and for me! What sort of people ought we to be,

I was talking to some Canadians one night—and the Canadians are fine
boys. I was putting my foot on the platform, just about to begin, when a
bright young Canadian touched me and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Say, boss, can <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">you</span></span> shoot
quick?”</span> and I replied,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes, and straight.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“you'll do.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I had a great time with those fellows. Hundreds of those Canadian boys
stood up to say, <span class="tei tei-q">“God helping me, I am going to lead a better
life!”</span>—hundreds of them. And then I put another test to them. <span class="tei tei-q">“I want
you all to promise,”</span> I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“that you'll kneel down and say your
prayers to-night in the billet, and those of you who will promise to do
that 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page44">[pg 44]</span><a name="Pg44" id="Pg44" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>come up and shake hands with me as you go out.”</span> I was kept one
half-hour shaking hands.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, there were nine fellows sleeping in one billet and not one knew the
other eight had been to the meeting. They all got mixed up, but all the
nine came up to shake hands, and the one that got back to billets first
told the story afterwards. This one had made up his mind he would kneel
down and say his prayers, but when he returned he found there was no one
there. Somehow he felt different then—he felt he couldn't do it. He was
more afraid of nobody than he would have been of somebody. Then just
suppose the others came back and found him kneeling there!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“I funked it,”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“I got under the blanket, and tried to say my
prayers under the blanket, but it wouldn't work. Then I heard one man
come into the room, then two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight.
And the eighth man was the champion swearer of the company.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Boys,”</span> said this man, <span class="tei tei-q">“did you hear him?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Yes,”</span> they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“we heard him.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the little chap under the blanket said <span class="tei tei-q">“Yes”</span> too.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, I shook hands with that man, and I promised him for my mother's
sake that I'd kneel down and say my prayers to-night.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the little chap under the blanket jumped up, blanket and all, and
said, <span class="tei tei-q">“So did I. I'm with you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And the others said, <span class="tei tei-q">“So did we.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well,”</span> the last comer said, <span class="tei tei-q">“the best thing we can do is to kneel down
now and say a little prayer.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So they all knelt down, and they each said a little prayer—I wish I had
a record of those prayers—and they finished up with <span class="tei tei-q">“Our Father.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then the champion swearer said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Boys, I've cut it all out: no more
drink—not another drop.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And they said, <span class="tei tei-q">“All right, we are with you. We'll cut it out.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I've cut something else out. No more swearing.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eighty-five times out of every hundred that the boys in France use a
swear-word they mean no more than I do when I say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Great Scott.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Do you, boys?”</span> I ask them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No, sir,”</span> they invariably reply.
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page46">[pg 46]</span><a name="Pg46" id="Pg46" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Well, then, why do you use these swear-words?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And then I've got them and, out of their own mouths, they are condemned.
I tell them it is bad form, and I say, <span class="tei tei-q">“Cut it out.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These boys made a solemn compact that night that the first man who swore
should clean all nine guns, and before the week was out my champion was
cleaning nine guns.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But those eight boys didn't go back on him. They were sporty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have seen a little bird's nest all broken with the wind and torn with
the storm, and two or three little eggs, with a few wet leaves over
them, addled and cold and forsaken, and my little gipsy heart cried over
those poor little motherless things, for I was motherless too. And up in
a tree I have heard a thrush singing the song of a seraph and I have
said, as I looked at the eggs, <span class="tei tei-q">“You would have been singers too, but you
were forsaken.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These boys—they did not forsake their chum. They said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Buck up, old
boy. We'll help you.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“No,”</span> he said. <span class="tei tei-q">“This is my job.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So they stood by him and cheered him on. 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page47">[pg 47]</span><a name="Pg47" id="Pg47" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
People, I say again, don't die
of overmuch love, but for the want of a bit of it. These boys stood by
my champion swearer, and when he was putting the polishing touches on
the last gun he stood up, his face radiant, like a man that has fought a
battle and won: <span class="tei tei-q">“Boys, this is the last gun I shall clean for anybody
under these conditions, because, God helping me, I'm going to see this
thing through.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

I was at a home for limbless men the other day—there are over one
hundred and eighty of them in that home. I held my hand out to shake
hands with the first two men I met, and they laughed at me. I looked
down for their hands—they hadn't got one between them! I took the face
of one of those dear boys and I patted it. I wanted to kiss it with
gratitude. I wonder how you feel!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I walked round amongst those boys—one hundred and eighty limbless! I
found one boy without legs and without an arm. He was just a trunk, and
his comrades, those who could, were carrying him around. He was the
sunshine in the whole place—not a grouse.

A friend of mine, a minister, went to see one of these boys, and he was
wondering what he could say to him; he thought he had got to cheer him
up. The boy looked at the padre and said,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Guv'nor, don't get down-hearted. I am going to make money out of this

only want a coat with one sleeve, and I shall only want a pair of boots
with one boot.”</span>

It reminds me of the question I once asked: <span class="tei tei-q">“Sonny, what struck you most

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

There was a dear old Scotchman from Aberdeen. A telegram had come to
that granite city to say that his boy was badly wounded, and he ran all
the way to the station and jumped into a train without stopping to put
on a collar. You don't think of collars when your boys are dying. I saw
him when he landed. It was my job to help him. The dear old fellow was
just in time to see his boy die—and afterwards he came and laid his
head on my shoulder and he sobbed. And I wept too. He was seventy.

Presently he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“It will be hard to go home and tell mother that her

Now, that's a proper question. I wonder what would happen if the

If a man's religion does not get into every detail of his life he may

The boys have given me the privilege of talking straight to them. <span class="tei tei-q">“If

out the note-paper. I can give boys writing-paper and envelopes and sell
them a cup of coffee or a packet of cigarettes with as much religion as
I can stand in a pulpit and talk about them. Why, my Master washed
people's

are no secular things if you are in the spirit of the Master—they are
all Divine.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Another boy, when I was making my appeal, said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I've been wounded and I
am discharged. I'll give my next week's pay,”</span> and up jumped a war-widow
and she said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I'll give my next week's pension.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was talking in Doncaster, and I had a batch of wounded men from one of
the local hospitals—a batch of twenty dressed in blue—and 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page56">[pg 56]</span><a name="Pg56" id="Pg56" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>every one
of them gave something; and when I looked round and said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Boys, why are
you giving?”</span> one said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Well, sir, we're grateful for what it did for us
when we were there.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
People say, <span class="tei tei-q">“What are you going to do with the huts after the war?”</span> We
want to pick them up, and bring them back to this country and put one
down in every parish in the land, so that when the boys do come back
they will still have the Y.M.C.A. hut to go into, so that they can still
keep up the spirit of unity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Woe be to the man who goes into the hut and tries to preach
sectarianism. The Y.M.C.A. is creating a spirit of unity amongst the
boys, and that is going on all the time. I want the limitations to
vanish at home. I want the ecclesiastical barriers to go. When you get
to Heaven the Lord will have to give Gabriel a job to introduce many
Christians to one another. You should see your boys, how they mix up.
They come in—the Roman Catholics, the Church of England, and the
Nonconformists and Plymouth Brethren and Salvation Army, and all
sorts—you don't know who's who. We are not quarrelling over religions
at 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page57">[pg 57]</span><a name="Pg57" id="Pg57" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the front—we are fighting and dying for the folks who are doing
that at home.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let's stop our religious nonsense. Religion's too big to be confined
within our four little walls. If our Church rules are so rigid that they
won't let us come together, then our Church rules are wrong. God never
made rules which divide men—all God's laws unite. Christ died that we
might be one, and it is time we got together. Your boys are bigger than
your Churches. You and I have got to rise to the opportunity. God help
us to do it!
</p><div class="tei tei-tb">* * * * * </div><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Somebody asks, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why does the Y.M.C.A. always want more new huts? Why not
move the old ones?”</span> What will the boys do who take the places of those
who have gone forward? When the line goes forward, it does not come
back—not in these days; it abides—and the boys who come up as a
support, they take the huts the other boys leave.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Y.M.C.A. stands for everything to your boys. It is their club, their
church, their recreation-room. It is their canteen—dry canteen, you may
be sure—it is their reading-room, it is their smoking-room, and why
should 
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page58">[pg 58]</span><a name="Pg58" id="Pg58" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not the Church of Jesus Christ provide places of recreation for
its own people? Why should it leave the public-house and the theatre to
do it all? We have lost lots of people because we have been so slow—we
have lost them, you and I, but we are learning sense in these days, and
the Y.M.C.A. has come to the help of the Churches, to be the
communication-trench between the Churches and the people.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is doing magnificent work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As I write these lines I think of one dear boy, a young sergeant, a
Public-School boy. I had watched him grow up. I knew his home, and as he
leaned against me he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Gipsy, I'm homesick; I want my mother,”</span> and
then, with a sob, he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tell me more about Jesus.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I was able to talk to him about his mother because I had lost mine, and
just because I love Jesus I was able to talk to him about the blessed
Jesus Who comes into a man's heart when he is sad, lonely, and homesick,
and helps him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He was lying on a stretcher, and it was my privilege to hold his hand
and to kiss him for his mother.
</p>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page59">[pg 59]</span><a name="Pg59" id="Pg59" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">“Gipsy,”</span> he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“does it mean West?”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sonny, it means West.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As I held his hand it flickered for a moment and he said, <span class="tei tei-q">“I am not
afraid to go. I know Christ. I found Him in your meetings, and—it's
great to die, for freedom.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And it was a great thing for me to be with your boy then.
